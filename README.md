**Will's Farming Tweaks** is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that enhances farming efficiency by improving the functionality of hoes, bonemeal, and farmland. With this mod, you can harvest crops in larger areas, speed up crop growth in a wider radius, and protect your farmland from being trampled.

## Features

### Hoe-Based Crop Harvesting

Harvest crops in a larger area depending on the hoe you use:

- **Wooden Hoe**: Single block.
- **Stone Hoe**: 3x3 area.
- **Iron & Golden Hoes**: 5x5 area.
- **Diamond Hoe**: 7x7 area.
- **Netherite Hoe**: 9x9 area.

Each harvest consumes 1 durability per crop, and the crops are automatically replanted.

### Area-Based Bonemeal Growth

Bonemeal affects not just the targeted crop but also surrounding crops in a radius. Crops closer to the target have a higher chance of growing.

### Farmland Protection

Farmland can no longer be trampled by players, animals, or mobs, keeping your crops safe from accidental damage.
